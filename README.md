Welcome, here you can find my portfolio website (available online at https://portfolio-lyonsxiis-projects.vercel.app/), which consists of a few projects I've been working on recently. Feel free to take a look at the source code, or click on the link and try it out for yourself.

The site is complete with transitions, adjustable settings and themes, and works both desktop and mobile.

The live site is deployed using Vercel for the frontend, with the backend consisting of a combination Render, and Neon to handle the PostgreSQL database.

Unfortunately due to the computational intensity of this machine learning method, prediction of new text is not available in the live demo. Feel free to download the code and run it locally if you'd like to give it a try, or watch the demo to get an idea of how it works.
