“Lord Logain and Taim have indeed patched up their
differences,” Welyn said, sitting inside the common room of The
Great Gathering. He wore bells in his dark braids, and he
smiled widely. He always had smiled too much. “Both were
worried about the division we’ve been suffering and agree it
isn’t good for morale. We need to be focused on the Last
Battle. This isn’t a time for squabbling.”

Androl stood just inside the door, Pevara beside him. It was
surprising, how quickly this building—a former warehouse—had
been transformed into a tavern. Lind had done her work well.
There were a respectable bar and stools, and though the tables
and chairs spread through the room didn’t match yet, the
place could seat dozens. She also had a library with a
considerable number of books, although she was very particular
about who she allowed to use it. On the second floor, she
planned private dining chambers and sleeping rooms for visitors
to the Black Tower. Assuming Taim started letting visitors in
again.
