The city of Maradon burned. Violent, twisting columns of
smoke rose from dozens of buildings. The careful city planning
kept the fires from spreading too quickly, but did not stop
them entirely. Human beings and tinder. They went together.
Ituralde crouched inside a broken building, rubble to his left,
a small band of Saldaeans to his right. He’d abandoned the
palace early on; it had been swarmed with Shadowspawn. He’d
left it packed with all the oil they’d been able to find, then had
the Asha’man set it aflame, killing hundreds of Trollocs and
Fades trapped inside.
He glanced out the window of his current hiding place. He
could have sworn he’d seen a patch of bare sky out the
window, but the ash and smoky haze in the air made it
difficult to tell. A building nearby burned so intensely that he
could feel the heat through the stone.
He used the smoke and the fire. Almost everything on a
battlefield could be an advantage. In this case, once Yoeli had
accepted that the city was lost, they’d stopped defending it.
Now they used the city as a killing ground.
The streets created a maze that Ituralde—with the help of the
Saldaeans—knew and his enemies did not. Every rooftop was a
ridge to give high ground, every alley a secret escape route,
every open square a potential trap.
The Trollocs and their commanders had made a mistake.
They assumed that Ituralde cared about protecting the city.
They mistook him. All he cared about now was doing as much
damage to them as possible. So, he used their assumptions
against them. Yes, their army was large. But any man who
had ever tried to kill rats knew that the size of his hammer
didn’t matter so long as the rats knew how to hide.
