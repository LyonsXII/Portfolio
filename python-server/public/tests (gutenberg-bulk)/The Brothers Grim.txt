In old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose
daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that
the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it
shone in her face. Close by the King’s castle lay a great dark forest,
and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day
was very warm, the King’s child went out into the forest and sat down
by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a
golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was
her favorite plaything.

Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess’s golden ball did
not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on
to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King’s
daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was
deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. On this she began to
cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as
she thus lamented some one said to her, “What ails thee, King’s
daughter? Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.” She
looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog
stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water. “Ah! old
water-splasher, is it thou?” said she; “I am weeping for my golden
ball, which has fallen into the well.”
