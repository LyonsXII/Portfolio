Gawyn tried to keep his mind on the landscape as he rode at
the head of the column. This sort of rolling terrain with its
scattered bunches of trees was just flat enough to make you
think you could see a long way, when in truth some of those
occasional long ridges and low hills were not quite so low as
they seemed. The wind was gusting up waves of dust today,
and dust could hide a lot, too. Dumaiâ€™s Wells lay just off the
road to his right, three stone wells in a small copse; the water
barrels could stand topping, and it was at least four days to
the next sure water, if the Alianelle Spring had not gone dry,
but Galina had ordered no stopping. He tried to hold his
attention where it should be, but he could not.
