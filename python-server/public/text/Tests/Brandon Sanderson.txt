“They lived high atop a place no man could reach, but all could visit. The tower
city itself, crafted by the hands of no man.”
—Though The Song of the Last Summer is a fanciful tale of romance from
the third century after the Recreance, it is likely a valid reference in this
case. See page 27 of Varala’s translation, and note the undertext.
They got better at carrying the bridge on its side. But not much better.
Kaladin watched Bridge Four pass, moving awkwardly, maneuvering the
bridge at their sides. Fortunately, there were plenty of handles on the
bridge’s underside, and they’d found how to grip them in the right way.
They had to carry it at less steep an angle than he’d wanted. That would
expose their legs, but may be he could train them to adjust to it as the
arrows flew.
As it was, their carry was slow, and the bridgemen were so bunched
up that if the Parshendi managed to drop a man, the others would stumble
over him. Lose just a few men, and the balance would be upset so they’d
drop it for certain.
This will have to be handled very carefully, Kaladin thought.
Syl fluttered along behind the bridge crew as a flurry of nearly
translucent leaves. Beyond her, something caught Kaladin’s eye: a
uniformed soldier leading a ragged group of men in a despondent clump.
Finally, Kaladin thought. He’d been waiting for another group of recruits.
He waved curtly to Rock. The Horneater nodded; he’d take over training.
It was time for a break anyway.
Kaladin jogged up the short incline at the rim of the lumberyard,
arriving just as Gaz intercepted the newcomers.
