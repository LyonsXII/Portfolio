avoring his stiff right leg, Thom bowed with a flourish of his
gleeman’s cloak that set the colorful patches fluttering. His eyes
felt grainy, but he made himself speak lightly. “A good morning
to you.” Straightening, he knuckled his long white mustaches
grandly.
The black-and-gold-clad servants looked surprised. The two
muscular lads straightened from the gold-studded red lacquer
chest, with a shattered lid, that they had been about to lift,
and the three women stilled their mops in front of them. The
hallway was empty along here except for them, and any excuse
to break their labor was good, especially at this hour. They
looked as tired as Thom felt, with slumping shoulders and dark
circles under their eyes.
“A good morning to you, gleeman,” the oldest of the women
said. A bit plump and plain-faced, perhaps, she had a nice
smile, weary as she was. “Can we help you?”
Thom produced four colored balls from a capacious coatsleeve
and began to juggle. “I am just going about trying to raise
spirits. A gleeman must do what he can.” He would have used
more than four, but he was fatigued enough to make even
that many an exercise in concentration. How long since he had
nearly dropped a fifth ball? Two hours? He stifled a yawn,
turned it into a reassuring smile. “A terrible night, and spirits
need lifting.”
