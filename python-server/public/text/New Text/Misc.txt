Lindon turned to face his mother, hiding the hole and the sealed jar
behind him. “Your son is honored to see you here, Mother. But why...I
mean, if I may ask why you...”
Seisha saved him the effort of explaining by walking forward and
leaning over the hole he'd dug. Her drudge gurgled as it floated over her
shoulder, no doubt detecting the Remnant sealed within.
“While the arena is under construction, the staff answer to me,” Seisha
said, kneeling to run a finger along his scripted jar. “I asked them to
report anyone entering tonight, but I never thought it would be you.”
Lindon was afraid to move, lest it somehow push his mother over the
edge from calm to furious. “I'm sorry to have disturbed you, then.”
Seisha stood, flipping brown hair over one shoulder. “You can think of
nothing else you've done that might warrant an apology?”
Despite the cool of the night, he broke out in a sudden sweat. He had
thought of cover stories depending on who caught him, but none of them
would pass his mother.
She looked into the hole with brown eyes, lighter than anyone else in
the clan. “Back home, we had a saying. 'The disciple follows the master,
but the genius blazes their own trail.' You should cover this up before
someone else sees it.”
Lindon wasted a second on astonishment before grabbing his shovel
and setting to work. He piled the dirt back in hastily, hoping she wouldn't
change her mind. “Mother, are you calling me a genius?”
“Obviously not. It's just a saying.” He couldn't deny a moment of
disappointment before his mother continued. “Nonetheless, I’m proud of
you.”
