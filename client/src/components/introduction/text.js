  introText: `Welcome! Here you'll find a portfolio I've put together to show off some of the projects I've worked on since I started learning to code. Source code for all of the projects seen here can be found on my Github page, so feel free to click on the link and take a look.`,
  aboutMeTextA: `I graduated from the University of Kent with a masters degree in mathematics and afterwards starting working as a contractor for and later become a full time employee of The Very Group working on their complaints processes, ranging from PPI to irresponsible lending complaints.`,
  aboutMeTextB: `Two years ago I decided to learn to code and I've been working away at it ever since. After having had some tangental exposure to coding during my degree its been fun to delve back into self-driven learning and mix the familiar with something new.`,
  aboutMeTextC: `I started off with data analysis using Python, moved into Python proper and since then I've picked up Javascript, the PERN webdev stack, and some others bits and pieces along the way such as data structures and algorithms, and machine learning. In the future my immediate plans are delving further into SQL, picking up Typescript, and getting to grips with a lower level language like C++.`,
  aboutMeTextD: `There's a lot of new areas I want to learn about and skills I want to pick up, so I'm excited at the prospect of being able to make use of the skills I've developed in a professional environment.`,
  interestsA: `Naturally I've spent a good amount of my free time coding recently but I have a few other areas that like to spend my time on.`,
  interestsB: `Recently I've gotten back into reading after a bit of an extended break with The Wheel of Time series having become a new personal favourite, as well as inspiration for a machine learning project you can find here.`,
  interestsC: `I also enjoy drawing, mostly pencil line work, some niche graphic design projects, and keeping up with the latest tech developments. I built my last two computers myself, and I like to keep with what new tech is coming out. Every so often I'll also check out what's happening with AI development, whether that be image generation models like Flux, new LLMs, or text to speech. A new model from Sesame has particuarly interested me, offering real time conversation with a basic but uncannily effective demo. Give it a try here: https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice`,
  interestsD: `Aside from that I like video games, being a fan of RPGs of pretty much any description, whether that be old school JRPGs like SMT3 or Final Fantasy 9 or more recent CRPG offerings like Baldurs Gate 3, and listening to music, with my taste being a mix but learning into alternative / indie, alt-rock, and folk-punk. You can listen to some of my favourites in the "indie" category of the Song Guesser game available to the right.`,
  songGuesserText1A: `An online game you can play in which you have to guess where the song playing is from based off a short clip. Choose from a few different categories including "Anime", "Indie", "TV Shows", and "Disney" and see how well you can do, or if you're confident play in sudden death mode where one wrong answer is a game over.`,
  songGuesserText1B: `Song names and sources are provided after each round, as well as an embeded youtube video of the song in full, so if you hear something you like you can jump straight into the full track and maybe find a new favourite. Each category has twenty songs with the options being randomly chosen each round, so there's a good variety no matter which category you pick.`,
  songGuesserText1C: `The project includes some fun animations and configurable settings to automatically play the current song and move onto the next one, making each round feel snappy and engaging, requiring the user only make their guess and move onto the next question.`,
  songGuesserText1D: `Song information is held in a simple datbase, with inserting new songs being as simple as entering the necessary information into an excel document, providing a 5s and 10s audio clip and then running the provided SQL code to post the new track.`,
  songGuesserText1ImgA: `Landing page, featuring an animated title and simple grid layout.`,
  songGuesserText1ImgB: `Example image caption`,
  songGuesserText2A: `This project is built using a React frontend using Styled Components, with the backend running off a basic Express server and a PostgreSQL database to hold the song information and file paths.`,
  songGuesserText2B: `Starting this project I wanted to create some kind of interactive game, building on some earlier projects I'd completed as part of a webdev course I completed, with a focus on creating something simple but with some fun animations and a nice responsive feel for the user.`,
  songGuesserText2C: `This version of the game is a modified version of an earlier stand-alone project, that version using Material UI. Although the backend is largely the same, the frontend was rebuilt from scratch using styled components, and the result is in my opinion a lot simpler, more easily readable, and led to a superior end result. It was satisfying going back to the initial project after I was done and getting a sense of how far I'd come in terms of both familiarity with CSS and general design. I'm also interested in moving back to Material UI for a new project now I have a better grasp of the fundamentals and would be better able to leverage its strengths for quickly iterating on designs.`,
  songGuesserText2ImgA: `Game window, main titles that don't quite fit will show elipsis and can be clicked on to scroll through the rest of the text.`,
  songGuesserText2ImgB: `Original design created using Material UI.`,
  songGuesserText3A: `Currently I find the game works quite well and I've been having fun testing it out, however there is of course potential room for improvement and a lot more that could be done with the concept.`,
  songGuesserText3B: `In terms of basic functionality I'd be interested in exploring adding new modes of play, perhaps a fully random category, a timed gamemode, or a challenge mode in which the user has to type at least a part of the correct answer.`,
  songGuesserText3C: `In regard to expanding on the concept as a whole, I think it would be potentially be quite fun to allow for user generated categories, which on a test basis could be as creating a menu for users to upload their own mp3 files, fill in the information required, and submit their new additions for review. Expanding the menu to include an arbitrary number of categories would be quite simple, or if intent on producing something more similar to a real use case the design could be overhauled entirely to provide search functionality and perhaps a list of recently created or updated categories.`,

  faradayCageText1A: `This project is an interactable browser-based implementation of a mathematical model for aproximating the strength of a Faraday cage in two dimensions, taken from a paper titled "Mathematics of the Faraday Cage" by S. Jonathan Chapman, David P. Hewett, and Lloyd N. Trefethen.`,
  faradayCageText1B: `If a person were interested in blocking electromagnetic waves a reasonable means of doing so would be to contain them with a conductive material, known as a Faraday shield. Supposing that same person were to then make a series of holes in their shield the intuitive expectation would be that the waves would be able to pierce the shield through these holes, however interestingly this isn't the case, and the resultant Faraday cage still does an excellent job of blocking the electromagnetic waves. The purpose of this model, and the aforementioned paper, is to investigate how the size of these holes affects the shielding observed.`,
  faradayCageText1C: `Expanding on this paper was the subject of my fourth year disseration at university, and is in my opinion quite fun to play around with once you've managed to get it up and running. This implementation adapts the original code kindly provided and translates it into a more user friendly format, with a few modifications by myself.`,
  faradayCageText1ImgA: `General setup as outlined in the original paper, a simple top-down view of a Faraday cage in two dimensions.`,
  faradayCageText1ImgB: `Example image caption`,
  faradayCageText2A: `In terms of design this project is quite simple, being focused around a simple updating plot, with the more interesting content being centered around the mathematics going on behind the scenes. My goal for this project was to put a university project I had some fun with into a new context, but also to get some experience translating from one language into another, in this case Matlab into Javascript.`,
  faradayCageText2B: `Whilst there are alternative approaches for solving this problem, I found it to be an interesting exercise which gave me a newfound appreciation for just how useful Matlab can be when working with matrices when compared to other languages not centered around them.`,
  faradayCageText2C: `Although the translated code is significantly less performant it is capable of being ran in browser for up to a moderate number of disks which covers the majority of the change electromagnetic potential seen at the center of the disks. Unfortunately due to the nature of the calculations involving large matrices, further improvements would likely require compromises in accuracy, translation to a lower level language (manually or via making use of an automatic re-compiler) or using a more direct solution offered by Matlab itself.`,
  faradayCageText2D: ``,
  faradayCageText2ImgA: `Simple UI for adjusting the model settings.`,
  faradayCageText2ImgB: `Example image caption`,
  faradayCageText3A: `As a basic project I'm happy with the end result achieved, although there is potential for expansion in terms of incorporating some of the additional scenarios from my dissertation, such as multiple cages and alternate methods of disk placement and measuring the effectivness of the cage, these would likely require refactoring due to the increased computational load.`,
  faradayCageText3B: `As it stands I feel the interactive demo provides enough control for the user to play around with model and get some insight into the mathematics at work.`,
  faradayCageText3C: `Full details of the results that can be obtained using this model can be found in the original paper, and if you're interested feel free to read my own results in the full write up of my disseration project. Both papers can be accessed via clicking the links below:`,

  authorAnalysisText1A: `This is my most recently completed project I've worked on, and my current favourite, a text analysis dashboard including neural networks capable of determining the author of a given piece of provided text, and performing a topical and emotional analysis of the text provided.`,
  authorAnalysisText1B: `The dashboard also includes a number of other metrics (such as total number of words, lexical diversity, Flesch-Kincaid, etc) and associated plots to allow for a quick and easy analysis of a provided text excerpt, or as a point of comparison one of a number of famous novels.`,
  authorAnalysisText1C: `I collected the dataset need to build the author classification model from Project Gutenberg, an easy to access repository novels that are both out of copyright and easily recognisable to a general audience. I experimented with bulk downloading however I found this had detrimental effects on the model without needing to implement data sanitisation.`,
  authorAnalysisText1D: `My emotional analysis model was trained using the EmoBank dataset, which while difficult to parse, provided data of a comparable writing style to my author texts. I had initially attempted to make use of the GoEmotion dataset, however differences in writing styles led to poor results.`,
  authorAnalysisText1ImgA: `Landing page, choose between sample authors or inputting your own text.`,
  authorAnalysisText1ImgB: `Example image caption`,
  authorAnalysisText2A: `The impetus for this project was me wanting to try implementing AI into a project in some capacity, to that end I completed a course on machine learning and then spent some time thinking about how I could use the methods I learned about to solve a problem.`,
  authorAnalysisText2B: `Recently I've gotten back into reading after an extended break and a series I'd recently completed gave me an idea. One of the most notable facts about The Wheel of Time books are that the author, Robert Jordan died before finishing them but that they were then completed by another author, famous in his own right, Brandon Sanderson.`,
  authorAnalysisText2C: `It occured to me that this was a specific scenario that could make for an interesting analysis using machine learning, namely could a neural network reliably detect the difference in writing style not just between two different authors, but between an author and another attempting to write in their style using their characters and world.`,
  authorAnalysisText2D: `Currently my model does an excellent job of matching text not included in the dataset to its author, if part of that novel was included in the dataset, however further refinement is still needed to confidently classify based on general text. With a lower author pool this problem disappears, making me feel adjusting parameters or potentially moving to a new model could be the path forward when attempting to boost accuracy further.`,
  authorAnalysisText2ImgA: `Text prediction example, analysing text metrics and predicting author.`,
  authorAnalysisText2ImgB: `Generated word cloud example.`,
  authorAnalysisText3A: `Implementing this project led to a new number of technical challenges, due to needing to implement tensorflow into the project in order to handle the machine learning aspects, meaning I needed to add a Python backend to the project which presented some novel problems.`,
  authorAnalysisText3B: ` Notable amongst these were needing to make use of WSL2 to allow me to use my graphics card to speed up training, adding virtual environments into my project to resolve dependency issues, and learning to use Flask, a backend I had no previous experience of.`,
  authorAnalysisText3C: `The author classification model seen here started as a Naïve Bayes classifier, being followed by a basic neural network, before arriving at its current state, a fine-tuning of BERT. At each point I saw improvement, having spent time adjusting parameters and experimenting with each model in turn.`,
  authorAnalysisText3D: `I'm interested in trialing new approaches to this problem in the future, whether that be some form of evolution of BERT such as RoBERTa or ModernBERT, or something different like a convolutional neural network. Whilst I'm happy with the performance of my model, I view this implementation as just a proof of concept and I'd be interested in trying to find a better approach.`,
