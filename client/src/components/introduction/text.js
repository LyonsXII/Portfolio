  introText: `Welcome! Here you'll find a portfolio I've put together to show off some of the projects I've worked on since I started learning to code. Source code for all of the projects seen here can be found on my Github page, so feel free to click on the link and take a look.`,
  aboutMeTextA: `I graduated from the University of Kent with a masters degree in mathematics and afterwards starting working as a contractor for and later become a full time employee of The Very Group working on their complaints processes, ranging from PPI to irresponsible lending complaints.`,
  aboutMeTextB: `Two years ago I decided to learn to code and I've been working away at it ever since. After having had some tangental exposure to coding during my degree its been fun to delve back into self-driven learning and mix the familiar with something new.`,
  aboutMeTextC: `I started off with data analysis using Python, moved into Python proper and since then I've picked up Javascript, the PERN webdev stack, and some others bits and pieces along the way such as data structures and algorithms, and machine learning. In the future my immediate plans are delving further into SQL, picking up Typescript, and getting to grips with a lower level language like C++.`,
  aboutMeTextD: `There's a lot of new areas I want to learn about and skills I want to pick up, so I'm excited at the prospect of moving into coding professionally and being able to dedicate more time to coding.`,
  interestsA: `Naturally I've spend a good amount of my free time coding recently but I have a few other areas that like to spend my time on.`,
  interestsB: `Recently I've gotten back into reading after a bit of an extended break with The Wheel of Time series having become a new personal favourite, as well as inspiration for a machine learning project you can find here.`,
  interestsC: `I also enjoy drawing, mostly pencil line work, some niche graphic design projects, and keeping up with the latest tech developments. I built my last two computers myself, and I like to keep with what new tech is coming out. Every so often I'll also check out what's happening with AI development, whether that be image generation models like Flux, new LLMs, or text to speech. A new model from Sesame has particuarly interested me, offering real time conversation with a basic but uncannily effective demo. Give it a try here: https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice`,
  interestsD: `Aside from that I like video games, being a fan of RPGs of pretty much any description, whether that be old school JRPGs like SMT3 or Final Fantasy 9 or more recent CRPG offerings like Baldurs Gate 3, and listening to music, with my taste being a mix but learning into alternative / indie, alt-rock, and folk-punk. You can listen to some of my favourites in the "indie" category of the Song Guesser game available to the right.`,
  songGuesserText1A: `An online game you can play in which you have to guess where the song playing is from based off a short clip. Choose from a few different categories including "Anime", "Indie", "TV Shows", and "Disney" and see how well you can do, or if you're confident play in sudden death mode where one wrong answer is a game over.`,
  songGuesserText1B: `Song names and sources are provided after each round, as well as an embeded youtube video of the song in full, so if you hear a sound you like you can jump straight into the full track and maybe find a new favourite. Each category has twenty songs with the options being randomly chosen from the PostgreSQL backend each round, so there's a good variety no matter which category you pick.`,

  songGuesserText2A: `This project is built using a React frontend using Styled Components, with the backend running off a basic Express server and a PostgreSQL database to hold the song information and file paths.`,
  songGuesserText2B: `Starting this project I wanted to create some kind of interactive game, building on some earlier projects I'd completed as part of a webdev course I completed, with a focus on creating something simple but with some fun animations and a nice responsive feel for the user.`,
  songGuesserText2C: `This version of the game is a modified version of an earlier stand-alone project, that version using Material UI. Although the backend is largely the same I rebuilt the frontend from scratch, and the result is in my opinion a lot simpler, more easily readable, and led to a superior end result. It was satisfying going back to the initial project after I was done and getting a sense of how far I'd come in terms of both familiarity with CSS and general design.`,
  faradayCageTextA: `My dissertation at university was centered around getting to grips with and expanding upon a two dimensional model of a Faraday cage using Matlab. I had a surprising amount of fun putting it together way back when so I thought it might be interesting to update it a little and put it into a package other people can mess around with.`,
  faradayCageTextB: `Here you'll find an interactive webpage that lets you tinker with the conditions and see how changing the configuration of a Faraday Cage changes the shielding it provides.`,
  authorAnalysisTextA: `When I went on holiday this year I found myself getting back into reading after a longer break than I would've liked. In the interest of keeping organised I thought it might be fun to keep a record of the books I've been reading and my thoughts on them as I go. It's interesting how your thoughts on a book can change once you no longer have to deal with the author waxing lyrical about what clothes someone is wearing for pages on end.`,
  authorAnalysisTextB: `One of my first projects when I started learning about web development was putting together a book notes app, so I had a lot of fun with this one seeing how much progress I'd made.`
