  introText: `Welcome, here you'll find a portfolio I've put together to show off a few projects I've worked on since I started learning to code. Feel free to take a look and play around with whatever takes your fancy.`,
  songGuesserTextA: `An online game you can play in which you have to guess where the song playing is from based off a short clip. Choose from a few different categories including "Anime", "Indie", "TV Shows", and "Disney" and see how well you do.`,
  songGuesserTextB: `Song names and where they're from are given whether you get the answer right or wrong so this can be a good chance to find some new music you might like from a genre youre unfamilar with, or rediscover some tracks you'd forgotten about. Well that's if you share my taste in music at any rate.`,
  faradayCageTextA: `My dissertation at university was centered around getting to grips with and expanding upon a two dimensional model of a Faraday cage using Matlab. I had a surprising amount of fun putting it together way back when so I thought it might be interesting to update it a little and put it into a package other people can mess around with.`,
  faradayCageTextB: `Here you'll find an interactive webpage that lets you tinker with the conditions and see how changing the configuration of a Faraday Cage changes the shielding it provides.`,
  bookNotesTextA: `When I went on holiday this year I found myself getting back into reading after a longer break than I would've liked. In the interest of keeping organised I thought it might be fun to keep a record of the books I've been reading and my thoughts on them as I go. It's interesting how your thoughts on a book can change once you no longer have to deal with the author waxing lyrical about what clothes someone is wearing for pages on end.`,
  bookNotesTextB: `One of my first projects when I started learning about web development was putting together a book notes app, so I had a lot of fun with this one seeing how much progress I'd made.`
